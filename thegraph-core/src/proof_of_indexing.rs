//! A Proof of Indexing (POI) a cryptographic proof submitted by indexers to demonstrate that they

//! The POI is essentially a signature over a message digest that is generated during the indexing
//! of a subgraph from genesis. Each time a subgraphâ€™s state is updated, so does the message digest.
